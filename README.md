GA Android Immersive -Week 5 So here we are in Week 5 of our Android Immersive at General Assembly and things are progressing very well. We’ve created a To-do List app and now we are finishing up our second project which is Neighborhood Database App which are very cool I might add. To think that 5 weeks ago I was working at Morgan Stanley in my cubicle everyday doing the same work tasks and now I’m able to create things I like with my own twist. 


I’m not you’re typical coder, I’ve played sports my entire life so to go into a field where you’re the minority is sort of a culture shock although I’ve never had a problem fitting in and making new friends. I’ve learned in my life that to make progress you have to be willing to sacrifice so in a sense sports have made me well rounded through facing adversity almost everyday.Also I’ve pretty much done everything there is to do in life (work-wise),I’m what you call a modern day Renaissance man, just a man of many trades and I want to master all of them.

Halfway through the program and I’m feeling very advantageous about what’s to come in the near future career-wise for my classmates and I. In my opinion the program is teaching us to be well rounded Android Developers so that we can flourish after the program with company or on our own, I mean we have some real brainiacs in here.


When it comes to Custom Adapters that’s one of my stronger points, I like to create cool layouts and displays with the data we use. Majority of my life I’ve been a user of apps daily so to switch to the developing role I feel like I have a upper-hand because I know what types of functionalities the regular consumer would like to have in their favorite app. 

So far the course has been great and I always make sure to look back at where I started because that’s how you measure growth. Success doesn’t come overnight and that’s what keeps me grounded to make sure when things get difficult to put in more work and at some point the results will show. I once went from the kid in high school with no Lacrosse scholarship offers and after two years in Junior College was a top 5 recruit in the country at my position, so I know what hard work and dedication can do and the same process I used to become good in lacrosse will be the same process to become the next great coder. 

Funny the things you can learn and create in 5 weeks!
